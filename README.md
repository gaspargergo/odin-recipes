# odin-recipes
A recipe website for the Odin project. This is an excercise to practice basic HTML. 

The completion of this website shows my ability to use links, headers, lists and images in an HTML file. Since I was familiar with these elements beforehand, this excercise was great to focus on getting better (and quicker) at things I am not very comfortable with, such as the git workflow and the more powerful features of Vim.
